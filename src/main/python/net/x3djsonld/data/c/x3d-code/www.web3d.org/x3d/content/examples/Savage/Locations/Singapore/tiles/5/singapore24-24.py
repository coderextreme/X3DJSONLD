#
# Now available: developmental python x3d.py package on PyPi for import.
#   This approach greatly simplifies Python X3D deployment and use.
#   https://pypi.org/project/x3d
#
# Installation:
#       pip install x3d
# or
#       python -m pip install x3d
#
# Developer options for loading x3d package:
#
#    from x3d import *  # preferred approach, terser source that avoids x3d.* class prefixes
#
# or
#    import x3d         # traditional way to subclass x3d package, all classes require x3d.* prefix
#                       # but python source is very verbose, for example x3d.Material x3d.Shape etc.
#                       # X3dToPython.xslt stylesheet insertPackagePrefix=true supports this option.

from x3d import *
