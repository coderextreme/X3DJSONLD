#
# Now available: developmental python x3d.py package on PyPi for import.
#   This approach greatly simplifies Python X3D deployment and use.
#   https://pypi.org/project/x3d
#
# Installation:
#       pip install x3d
# or
#       python -m pip install x3d
#
# Developer options for loading x3d package:
#
#    from x3d import *  # preferred approach, terser source that avoids x3d.* class prefixes
#
# or
#    import x3d         # traditional way to subclass x3d package, all classes require x3d.* prefix
#                       # but python source is very verbose, for example x3d.Material x3d.Shape etc.
#                       # X3dToPython.xslt stylesheet insertPackagePrefix=true supports this option.

from x3d import *

    meta(content='Test of basic OrientationInterpolator functionality. An OrientationInterpolator node is used to change the orientation of a Box geometry. The fraction_changed eventOut of a TimeSensor node is used to change the orientation from keyValues of 0, 90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees about the X, Y and Z axes, using 1000 keys and keyValues. The value_changed eventOut is routed to the set_rotation exposedField of the Transform node of the geometry. The result thould be: The Box should rotate about the X axis one full revolution, the about the Y axis, then about the Z axis. All three revolutions should complete every 5 seconds.',name='description'),
