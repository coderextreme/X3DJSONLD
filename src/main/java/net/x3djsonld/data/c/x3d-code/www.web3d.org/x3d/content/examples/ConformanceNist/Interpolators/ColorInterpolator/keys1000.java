/**
 * <p> Test of a ColorInterpolator ability to interpolate between a minimum conformance requirement of 1000 key/keyValue pairs. The fraction_changed eventOut of a TimeSensor node is used to change the color from keyValues blue to yellow and back to blue, created by combining sine functions of red and green and cosine function of blue over a 180 degree arc. The result should be a sphere geometry that changes from blue, to yellow, to blue in a 5 second interval. </p>
