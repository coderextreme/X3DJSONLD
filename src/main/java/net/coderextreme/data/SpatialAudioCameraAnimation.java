Through the immersion in the X3D scene the user could attend a rational navigation. Whenever the camera moves in the direction of an existing sound source, the strength of this source increases, while the sound strength of the other (the second one) decreases and vice versa. Through this process, great realism of the scene is achieved, since it emulates the spatial sound in real world."))
