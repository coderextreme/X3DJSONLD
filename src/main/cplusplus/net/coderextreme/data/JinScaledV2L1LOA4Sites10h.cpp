This allows the skeleton structure user code to be simplified. example: <HAnimJoint DEF='hanim_humanoid_root' name='humanoid_root' containerField='skeleton' center='0 0.826 -0.016'> <HAnimSegment DEF='hanim_sacrum' name='sacrum'> <Shape USE='sacrum_Shape'/> <Group USE='sacrum_Sites'/> </HAnimSegment> ... entire sheleton hierarchy ,,, </HAnimJoint Please Run the example. It starts with Kick2. Select any other Action from the menu. Animations for Pitch1, Yaw1, and Roll1 show basic operation by animation of each Joint of the skeleton that contains one or more Site surface feature landmarks. A colored sphere marker identifies a V2 Site object. The Pitch2, Yaw2, Roll2, Jump1, and Jump2 were connected from existing x3d HAnim archived example animations. All these need some work to show full loa4 articulation and the advantages of this standard skeleton hierarchy.
