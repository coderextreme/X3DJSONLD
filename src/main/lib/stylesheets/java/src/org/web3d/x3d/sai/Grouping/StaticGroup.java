 * <i>X3D node tooltip</i>: StaticGroup is a Grouping node that can contain most nodes. StaticGroup children are guaranteed to not change, send events, receive events, or include re-USE-able content. This allows browser optimizations of contained-node content.

 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> insert a Shape node before adding geometry or Appearance. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Warning:</i>  requires X3D profile='Full' or else include &amp;lt;component name='Grouping' level='3'/&amp;gt; </li>
