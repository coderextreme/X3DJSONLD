/**
 * Concrete implementation class corresponding to X3DField.
 * 
 * <br><br>

 * <br>
 * <i>Package hint:</i>  This specification class is defined by the X3D Java Language Binding Specification for the Scene Authoring Interface (SAI).

 * <p>
 * Representation of a node's field definition.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The field definition holds static field information such as the field
 * access type, data type and name of the field.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the toString() method of this class shall return the
 * full IDL declaration of the field as per the specification, not the UTF8 or
 * XML format. Implementation of <code>.equals()</code> shall return true if
 * the two field definitions share the same access type, data type and name. It
 * shall not include the underlying field's values at that point in time.
 * </p>
