 * Abstract node interface, defined by X3D specification to support X3D Java interoperability.

 * <br><br>
 * <i>X3D node tooltip</i>: Extrusion is a geometry node that sequentially stretches a 2D cross section along a 3D-spine path in the local coordinate system, creating an outer hull. Scaling and rotating the crossSection 2D outline at each control point can modify the outer hull of the Extrusion to produce a wide variety of interesting shapes.
