/**
 * Abstract node interface, defined by X3D specification to support X3D Java interoperability.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * <i>X3D node tooltip</i>: Polyline2D is a geometry node that defines a connected set of vertices in a contiguous set of line segments in X-Y plane.
 * <ul>
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> Material emissiveColor in corresponding Appearance is used for rendering lines. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Warning:</i> lines are not lit, are not texture-mapped, and do not participate in collision detection. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Warning:</i> use a different Material emissiveColor than the Background color, otherwise geometry is invisible. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> adding LineProperties to the corresponding Appearance node can modify the rendering style of these lines. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i>  insert a Shape node before adding geometry or Appearance. Example: X3D Example Archives, X3D for Web Authors, Chapter 10 Geometry 2D <br> <a href="https://x3dgraphics.com/examples/X3dForWebAuthors/Chapter10Geometry2D" target="_blank">https://x3dgraphics.com/examples/X3dForWebAuthors/Chapter10Geometry2D</a> </li> 
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <i>Package hint:</i>  This interface is defined by the X3D Java Language Binding Specification for the Scene Authoring Interface (SAI).
