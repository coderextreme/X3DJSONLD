         	The X3D Java Scene Access Interface (SAI) package is designed to 
         	provide access to a browser and its contained scene graph,
         	either within an internal X3D Script node or an external HTML script.
      </p>
      <p>
         	This package contains specification-defined X3D SAI interfaces and utility classes,
         
         	used for compiling Java source code to be used by an X3D Script node.
