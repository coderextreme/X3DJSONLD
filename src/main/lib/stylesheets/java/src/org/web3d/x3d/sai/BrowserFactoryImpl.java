/**
 * Implementation of factory class for obtaining references to browser instances.
 * 
 * <br><br>

 * <br>
 * <i>Package hint:</i>  This interface is defined by the X3D Java Language Binding Specification for the Scene Authoring Interface (SAI).
 * 
<p>
The factory implementation interface for obtaining references to browser
instances.
</p>
<p>
Any implementation of a X3D browser that wishes to provide their own
customised version of the browser factory should must subclass this class.
In particular this is useful if the implementation needs to stay within the
package defined by the application for other reasons.
</p>
<p>
A default implementation of this class is the DefaultBrowserFactoryImpl which
is package access only.
