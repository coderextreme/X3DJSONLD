/**
 * Abstract node interface, defined by X3D specification to support X3D Java interoperability.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * <i>X3D node tooltip</i>: (X3D version 3.2 or later) VolumePickSensor tests picking intersections using the pickingGeometry against the pickTarget geometry volume.
 * <ul>
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> sort order is based on distance between centers of the bounds of the picking geometry and the picked geometry. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Warning:</i> pickingGeometry volume is defined by the convex hull of the enclosing planes of the provided X3DGeometryNode. If the provided volume is not manifold, pick results are undefined. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> a pick is successful if any vertex of the pickTarget geometry intersects the volume defined by the pickingGeometry. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> Sorting is defined based on distance between the centers of the bounds of the picking geometry and the picked geometry. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> picking is performed between rendered frames of the event model. An author sets up the picking request in one frame by placing a LinePickSensor in the desired location. At the start of the next frame, any picking intersections are reported by the pick sensor. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> picking notification is performed at the start of the frame for all enabled pick sensors once all other sensors are processed. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> event timing details are explained in X3D Specification 4.4.8.3 Execution model <br> <a href="http://www.web3d.org/files/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/concepts.html#ExecutionModelWarning" target="_blank">http://www.web3d.org/files/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/concepts.html#ExecutionModelWarning</a>: order of contained nodes is significant, single pickingGeometry node must precede pickTarget node array. </li>
