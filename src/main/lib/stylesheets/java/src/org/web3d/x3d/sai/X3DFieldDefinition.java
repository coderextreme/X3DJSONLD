/**
 * Representation of a node's field definition.
 * 
 * <br><br>

 * <br>
 * <i>Package hint:</i>  This interface is defined by the X3D Java Language Binding Specification for the Scene Authoring Interface (SAI).
 * 
The field definition holds the static field information such as the field
access type, the data type and the name of the field.

The implementation of the toString() method of this class shall return the
full IDL declaration of the field as per the specification, not the UTF8 or
XML format. Implementation of .equals() shall return true if
the two field definitions share the same access type, data type and name. It
shall not include the underlying field's values at that point in time.
