 * Abstract node interface, defined by X3D specification to support X3D Java interoperability.

 * <i>Package hint:</i>  This interface is defined by the X3D Java Language Binding Specification for the Scene Authoring Interface (SAI).

<p>
Provides for implementation of a X3D player than runs as a
component and able to extract a Browser reference from it.
</p>
<p>
Generally this is used to provide a definition of an AWT component with a
VRML/X3D display capability. There is no reason why this can not be used for
other browser representations such as off-screen renderers or file savers.
