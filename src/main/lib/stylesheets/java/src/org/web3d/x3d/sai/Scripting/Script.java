/**
 * Abstract node interface, defined by X3D specification to support X3D Java interoperability.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * <i>X3D node tooltip</i>: Script contains author-programmed event behaviors for a scene. Define the script input-output event interface by including &amp;lt;field/&amp;gt; elements. Scripting code is embedded in a child CDATA node or (deprecated) in the url field. Optionally supported programming languages are ECMAScript (JavaScript) and Java (via url to a myNode.class file).
 * <ul>
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> insert a CDATA node to contain source code embedded within an X3D scene. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> a contained CDATA block for source code protects whitespace, line breaks, and literal characters (such as &amp; for ampersand character, &amp;lt; for less-than-sign character, and &amp;gt; for greater-than-sign character) from unintended escape-character modifications by XML parsers. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Warning:</i> strict order is required for contained constructs: first field declarations, then IS/connect statements (if any), and finally CDATA source-code block. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i>  X3D Scene Authoring Hints, Scripts <br> <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dSceneAuthoringHints.html#Scripts" target="_blank">http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dSceneAuthoringHints.html#Scripts</a> </li>
