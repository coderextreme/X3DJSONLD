 * <i>X3D node tooltip</i>: (X3D version 3.2 or later) [X3DPickSensorNode] PrimitivePickSensor tests picking intersections using one of the basic primitive shapes specified in the pickingGeometry field [Cone|Cylinder|Sphere|Box] against the pickTarget geometry.
 * <ul>
 *  <li> <i>Warning:</i> boolean fields used to control visibility of primitive pickingGeometry subsections are ignored when evaluating picking intersections. Example: a Cylinder without end caps is still treated as an enclosed Cylinder. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> Sorting is defined based on the primitive type as follows. For Cone, the closest picked primitive is defined to be that closest to the vertex point. For Cylinder, Box, and Sphere, the closest picked primitive is defined to be that closest to the center. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> picking is performed between rendered frames of the event model. An author sets up the picking request in one frame by placing a LinePickSensor in the desired location. At the start of the next frame, any picking intersections are reported by the pick sensor. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> picking notification is performed at the start of the frame for all enabled pick sensors once all other sensors are processed. </li> 
 *  <li> <i>Hint:</i> event timing details are explained in X3D Specification 4.4.8.3 Execution model <br> <a href="http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/concepts.html#ExecutionModelWarning" target="_blank">http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/concepts.html#ExecutionModelWarning</a>: order of contained nodes is significant, single pickingGeometry node must precede pickTarget node array. </li>
