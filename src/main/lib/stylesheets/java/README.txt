X3D Java Scene Access Interface Library (X3DJSAIL)

X3DJSAIL supports programmers with standards-based X3D Java interfaces and
objects, all as open source. 

X3DJSAIL defines a set of strongly typed application programming interfaces
(APIs) providing programmer access to a Java-based X3D scene graph.
Two open-source Java packages are included that contain X3D SAI interfaces
and support the X3D Specifications for Java programmers. 

* org.web3d.x3d.jsail provides concrete classes to create and modify X3D scenes
  using Java objects, suitable for a variety of independent programs.

* org.web3d.x3d.sai provides SAI interfaces suitable for X3D Script node
  compilation, with subsequent scene re-use within a variety of X3D players.

Goals include making it easy to create an X3D scene graph using Java,
while also making it hard to create an incorrect or invalid X3D model.

Design details for the Java SAI Library can be found in the project summary
and javadoc documentation, bundled locally and published online.
