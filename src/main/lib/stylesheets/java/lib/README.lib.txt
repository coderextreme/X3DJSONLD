README.lib.txt

This directory tree contains external library code, schemas, stylesheets and
related assets for use by X3DJSAIL libraries.

- Currently X3D schemas, DTDs and stylesheets are copied from master versions
  (maintained separately) to ensure latest working versions are included.
- Intent is to be sure best copies are included, deploys do not include any
  lib assets with known errors (though test development may be in progress).
- Updated lib copies are periodically checked in, reflecting updates here.

For more information and latest version please see
