"@content":"Test jumpcut Viewpoint transition using Script loadUrl method. A NavigationInfo
type of ANY is NOT included in the NavigationInfo node field in this world. Consequently,
a Script node with a call to the \"loadURL\" method, with a url corresponding to the
MFString \"Top_View\" (the name of a Viewpoint in this world) should create a \"jump
cut\" transition of views when the Box geometry in this world is indicated by the
pointing device. As a result, indicating the Box geometry should result in a Viewpoint
transition to the top view of the Box geometry."
