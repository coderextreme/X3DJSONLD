This allows the skeleton structure user code to be simplified. example: <HAnimJoint DEF='hanim_humanoid_root' name='humanoid_root' containerField='skeleton' center='0 0.826 -0.016'> <HAnimSegment DEF='hanim_sacrum' name='sacrum'> <Shape USE='sacrum_Shape'/> <Group USE='sacrum_Sites'/> </HAnimSegment> ... entire sheleton hierarchy ,,, </HAnimJoint Please Run the example. It starts with Kick2. Select any other Action from the menu. Animations for Pitch1, Yaw1, and Roll1 show basic operation by animation of each Joint of the skeleton that contains one or more Site surface feature landmarks. A colored sphere marker identifies a V2 Site object. The Pitch2, Yaw2, Roll2, Jump1, and Jump2 were connected from existing x3d HAnim archived example animations. All these need some work to show full loa4 articulation and the advantages of this standard skeleton hierarchy.

Thus, 1 radian in a times scale 1 = +1 radian = about 60 degrees 360 degrees divided by 2 times pi greater than +-6.28 radians range Right hand rule for axes so a positive pitch value applied to the skullbase Joint would rotate the the gaze of model down, toward the floor.

Thus, 1 radian in a times scale 1 = +1 radian = about 60 degrees 360 degrees divided by 2 times pi Right hand rule for axes so a positive roll value applied to the skullbase Joint would rotate the the gaze of model ccw toward the model's +X direction, the model left toward the left shoulder.
