<p><font color="#000000">Here are a few more things from an email
from Greg Roelofs about these files:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Delle mentioned that she used Photoshop
4.0 to create the textures, which<br>
explains much of this (large default PNG file sizes). I've never
used it myself, but I believe it does<br>
have options to disable interlacing, enable dynamic line filters,
and save<br>
PNG images as 8-bit palette/indexed/colormapped files, even
though those<br>
aren't the defaults. Setting these options where appropriate
will, in most<br>
cases, make up much of the difference between GIF and PNG. More
discussion<br>
can be found at</font><a
href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/pngintro.html"><font

<p><font color="#000000">...PNG does indeed win over GIF in every
case here--although only pngcrush<br>
managed to pull it off with the grayscale linoleum1. The fact
that that<br>
file had only 32 levels of gray and relatively sharp edges may
also explain<br>
why JPEG fared so poorly, although I didn't check into it
explicitly.<br>
<br>
Note that in most cases the various command-line tools give
essentially<br>
the same results, and what little discrepancy there is can be
partially<br>
explained by the presence or absence of certain optional PNG
chunks--for<br>
example, gif2png always includes a 39-byte tEXt chunk identifying
itself<br>
as the conversion utility. pngcrush looks to be a very useful
tool once<br>
it's released, though.<br>
<br>
Finally, note that RGBA palettes are an alternative to 16-bit
gray+alpha<br>
and 32-bit RGBA (or--egad--32-bit GA and 64-bit RGBA). Generally
one<br>
must do a lossy quantization of an image with a full alpha
channel in <br>
order to fit it into 256 palette entries, but the instant
factor-of-four<br>
compression is often worth it. I hope to release some improved
tools for<br>
this in the next few months. </font></p>
