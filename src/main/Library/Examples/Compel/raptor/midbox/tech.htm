</CENTER><P>Raptor Builder was created with Cosmo Worlds 1.0. HTML images were created in Photoshop 3.0. Raptor Builder uses several different VRML 2.0 features including advanced animated lighting techniques, spatialized audio, and keyframe animation. RaptorBuilder also uses color per vertex shading combined with texture mapping to give greater depth to the models. The joints on the dinosaur, which allow it to be posed, were created with cylinder sensors.  The platform is a 3D widget which allows you to explore computer graphics and texture mapping.</P>
